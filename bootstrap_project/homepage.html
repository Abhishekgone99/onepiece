                        the same
                        day.
                        Raised
                        together as children,
                        they came to know of the "Wizard King"—a title given to the strongest mage in the kingdom—and
                        promised that they would compete against each other for the position of the next Wizard King.
                        However, as they grew up, the stark difference between them became evident. While Yuno is able
                        to wield magic with amazing power and control, Asta cannot use magic at all and desperately
                        tries to awaken his powers by training physically. When they reach the age of 15, Yuno is
                        bestowed a spectacular Grimoire with a four-leaf clover, while Asta receives nothing. However,
                        soon after, Yuno is attacked by a person named Lebuty, whose main purpose is to obtain Yuno's
                        Grimoire. Asta tries to fight Lebuty, but he is outmatched. Though without hope and on the brink
                        of defeat, he finds the strength to continue when he hears Yuno's voice. Unleashing his inner
                        emotions in a rage, Asta receives a five-leaf clover Grimoire, a "Black Clover" giving him
                        enough power to defeat Lebuty. A few days later, the two friends head out into the world, both
                        seeking the same goal—to become the Wizard King!</p>

                        become the Hokage of Konohagakure leads him not only to some great new friends, but also some
